# Live sync in React Native with CouchDb

## Intro

In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a live game with data updating on multiple devices.

For this, let's make a game! A game where players can fight against each other in live. Let's make a live `Rock - Paper - Scissors` game.

This project is a perfect opportunity to see how to build live data syncs in React Native with CouchDb. Of course, there are many more use cases with these two technologies but it is a good start.

In this article, we will dive into a game Rock-Paper-Scissors I created previously, and thanks to CouchDb, we do not need to build any backend! At the end, we will have a React Native app connected to a local CouchDb database. The game is already ready in a repo I created, so we can focus on the essential parts: the live sync & update on our React component.

## 1. Overview

### Rock-Paper-Scissors

What will do exactly our online game?

Two players will play the famous Rock-Paper-Scissors and join a game with its id. Other users will be able to join the game and be spectators. Theses games will update whenever a player plays a roud. Finally, we will display the score.

Here a demo of what a player will experiment.

First steps is to clone the [repo](https://github.com/jcalixte/rnrps/), run the command `yarn` and rename the `.env.example` in `.env`.

### What is CouchDb

Before getting deep into the app, it seems important to know the techology behind.

#### CouchDb

CouchDb is a NoSQL database accessible via a RESTFUL API. The particularity is that each update of a document (NoSQL data) is a new document linked to its previous versions by a common `_id`. Data in CouchDb are immutables. So, as in git, a historic tree can be made listing all the modification of a document. Each update creates a modification of the property `_rev` like `_rev: 12-ad32d26`, this is the version of the document (`_rev` is for `revision` ðŸ¤«).

CouchDb masters in database replications. As it is possible to know what has been modified by an `_id` and a `_rev` prop, it is easy for a database de to know the delta and replicate from another one. What is important for us will be the replication of a distant database to a local one.

[CouchDb Documentation](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/)

For our game we need to install it locally.

### Installation

To install CouchDb locally, go to their [website](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/install/index.html). The install is really straightforward;

#### Configuration

Create a admin and configure CouchDb as a single node.

#### Create the `RPS` database

Then, go to the "Databases" tab and create de database called `rps`.

#### PouchDb

If CouchDb is able to store data in a server, PouchDb helps us manipulate data in locale database the same way as CouchDb! This is awesome! We will implement the same methods for locale and distant database!

`PouchDb` has a very helpful method that is `sync`.

> CouchDB was designed with sync in mind, and this is exactly what it excels at. Many of the rough edges of the API serve this larger purpose. For instance, managing your document revisions pays off in the future, when you eventually need to start dealing with conflicts.

[PouchDb Documentation](https://pouchdb.com/guides/replication.html)

## Let's dive into the code!

### Sync

We want to share in real time a document `Play`. How to do so? We are going to replicate the local database and the database from the server. PouchDb has a really good method for it called `sync` and it is used like this : `localDB.sync(remoteDB)`. This method is a shortcut for :

```TypeScript
localDB.replicate.to(remoteDB);
localDB.replicate.from(remoteDB);
```

`sync` has options, and if we adapt it for our game, we want:

- a live sync so we add the property `sync` to `true`,
- a synchronisation that persists and retry when there are connection problems so we put the `retry`prop to `true`.
- We don't want to synchronise the whole database but only the current game! Hopefully, CouchDb and PouchDb can manage that for us with a [filtered replication](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#replication). There are many ways to do a filtered replication but the most efficient is to give to `sync` the array of ids we want to listen to.

For more details, I suggest you see the excelent [PouchDb documentation](https://pouchdb.com/guides/replication.html#setting-up-sync)

So, if we see the whole code, here we have:

```TypeScript
// Repository/index.ts

public liveGame(id: string): void {
  this.cancelLive();
  const ids = [`${id}_${Player.Player1}`, `${id}_${Player.Player2}`];
  this.sync = this.local
    .sync<{}>(this.remote, {
      live: true,
      retry: true,
      doc_ids: ids,
    })
    .on('change', result => {
      console.log('change', result);
      bus.emit(SYNC_UP, {
        id,
        result,
      });
    });
}
```

In conclusion this is pretty simple and intuitive, isn't it?
We added an event `SYNC_UP` to make our `React` component reactive. We will listen to it later.

### Merge

In a game, each player will update his own document so we will not have to deal with conflicts. But our component just want to handle one document `Play` to display plays and scores. So we have a final work to do, we need to fetch the two documents in the database and merge them into one.

It is done in the file `PlayService.`, we can call this method `mergePlays` where we use a spread operator to merge the two documents. There is a little more work when we want to gather play turns in which each players update their moves. We loop through each `turn`, retrieve the move of the player 1 in the player 1's document and retrieve the move of the player 2 in the player 2's document. Like this:

```TypeScript
// PlayService.ts

private mergePlays(play1: IPlay | null, play2: IPlay | null): IPlay | null {
  if (!play1 || !play2) {
    return play1 || play2;
  }
  const play = {
    ...play1,
    ...play2,
  };
  const turnCount = Math.max(play1.turns.length, play2.turns.length);

  if (!turnCount) {
    play.turns = [];
  } else {
    play.turns = Array.from({length: turnCount}).map((_item, index) => {
      const turn1 = play1.turns[index];
      const turn2 = play2.turns[index];

      const player1 = turn1 ? turn1.player1 : null;
      const player2 = turn2 ? turn2.player2 : null;

      const turn: ITurn = {
        player1,
        player2,
        winner: null,
      };
      turn.winner = this.getWinner(turn);
      return turn;
    });
  }
  return play;
}
```

## Conclusion

So we've completed our first live sync between two databases in React Native, awesome! There is so much more we can explore now. Here a few examples:

- create an offline first experience app to provide a seemless usage either the app is online or offline.
- create an app that share data in Bluetooth without the need of an Internet connection (like shareable books in region where Internet is expansive)
- create an app where people can collaborate in live.
- and so on...
